    <h2>Hi, my name is Chester Chan-Hyun Park!</h2>
    <p>I made this website to archive my little articles that</p>
    <p>I've worked on everytime I was bored. Since I was in middle school I started to get interested in</p>
    <p>Fashion through my tutor. Now I love art, architecture and every type of design. </p>
